<dt><b>--dhcp-hostsfile=&lt;path&gt;</b></dt>
<dd>Read DHCP host information from the specified file. If a directory
is given, then read all the files contained in that directory in alphabetical order. The file contains 
information about one host per line. The format of a line is the same
as text to the right of '=' in <b>--dhcp-host</b>. The advantage of storing DHCP host information
in this file is that it can be changed without re-starting dnsmasq:
the file will be re-read when dnsmasq receives SIGHUP.</dd>
