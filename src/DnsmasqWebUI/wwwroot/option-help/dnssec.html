<dd>Validate DNS replies and cache DNSSEC data. When forwarding DNS queries, dnsmasq requests the 
DNSSEC records needed to validate the replies. The replies are validated and the result returned as 
the Authenticated Data bit in the DNS packet. In addition the DNSSEC records are stored in the cache, making 
validation by clients more efficient. Note that validation by clients is the most secure DNSSEC mode, but for
clients unable to do validation, use of the AD bit set by dnsmasq is useful, provided that the network between 
the dnsmasq server and the client is trusted. Dnsmasq must be compiled with HAVE_DNSSEC enabled, and DNSSEC
trust anchors provided, see 
<b>--trust-anchor.</b>

Because the DNSSEC validation process uses the cache, it is not
permitted to reduce the cache size below the default when DNSSEC is
enabled. The nameservers upstream of dnsmasq must be DNSSEC-capable,
ie capable of returning DNSSEC records with data. If they are not,
then dnsmasq will not be able to determine the trusted status of
answers and this means that DNS service will be entirely broken.</dd>
