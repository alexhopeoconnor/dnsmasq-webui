<dd>Setting this provides a prompt to be displayed after PXE boot. If the
timeout is given then after the
timeout has elapsed with no keyboard input, the first available menu
option will be automatically executed. If the timeout is zero then the first available menu
item will be executed immediately. If 
<b>--pxe-prompt</b>

is omitted the system will wait for user input if there are multiple
items in the menu, but boot immediately if
there is only one. See
<b>--pxe-service</b>

for details of menu items.
<p>
Dnsmasq supports PXE "proxy-DHCP", in this case another DHCP server on
the network is responsible for allocating IP addresses, and dnsmasq
simply provides the information given in 
<b>--pxe-prompt</b>

and
<b>--pxe-service</b>

to allow netbooting. This mode is enabled using the
<b>proxy</b>

keyword in
<b>--dhcp-range.</b>

If the "other" DHCP server is on a remote network, it is
possible, and useful, to configure dnsmasq as both a PXE proxy-DHCP server
and a DHCP relay to the remote DHCP server. See
<b>--dhcp-relay</b>

for details. PXE is only supported over IPv4 at this time.</dd>
