<dd>Under normal circumstances, dnsmasq relies on DNS clients to do retries; it
does not generate timeouts itself. Setting this option
instructs dnsmasq to generate its own retries starting after a delay
which defaults to 1000ms. If the second parameter is given this controls
how long the retries will continue for
otherwise this defaults to 10000ms. Retries are repeated with exponential
backoff. Using this option increases memory usage and
network bandwidth. If not otherwise configured, this option is activated
with the default parameters when <b>--dnssec</b> is set.</dd>
