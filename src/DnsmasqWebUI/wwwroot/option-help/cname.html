<dt><b>--cname=&lt;cname&gt;,[&lt;cname&gt;,]&lt;target&gt;[,&lt;TTL&gt;]</b></dt>
<dd>Return a CNAME record which indicates that &lt;cname&gt; is really
&lt;target&gt;. There is a significant limitation on the target; it must be a
DNS record which is known to dnsmasq and NOT a DNS record which comes from
an upstream server. The cname must be unique, but it
is permissible to have more than one cname pointing to the same target. Indeed
it's possible to declare multiple cnames to a target in a single line, like so:
<b>--cname=cname1,cname2,target</b>
<p>
If the time-to-live is given, it overrides the default, which is zero
or the value of <b>--local-ttl</b>. The value is a positive integer and gives
the time-to-live in seconds.</dd>
