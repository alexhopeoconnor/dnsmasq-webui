<dt><b>--conntrack</b></dt>
<dd>Read the Linux connection track mark associated with incoming DNS
queries and set the same mark value on upstream traffic used to answer
those queries. This allows traffic generated by dnsmasq to be
associated with the queries which cause it, useful for bandwidth
accounting and firewalling. Dnsmasq must have conntrack support
compiled in and the kernel must have conntrack support
included and configured. This option cannot be combined with
