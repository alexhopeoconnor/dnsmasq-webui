<dd>Enable a network mode which is a hybrid between 
<b>--bind-interfaces</b>

and the default. Dnsmasq binds the address of individual interfaces,
allowing multiple dnsmasq instances, but if new interfaces or
addresses appear, it automatically listens on those (subject to any
access-control configuration). This makes dynamically created
interfaces work in the same way as the default. Implementing this
option requires non-standard networking APIs and it is only available
under Linux. On other platforms it falls-back to <b>--bind-interfaces</b> mode.</dd>
