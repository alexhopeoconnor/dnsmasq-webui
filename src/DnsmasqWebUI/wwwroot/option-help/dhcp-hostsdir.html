<dt><b>--dhcp-hostsdir=&lt;path&gt;</b></dt>
<dd>This is equivalent to <b>--dhcp-hostsfile</b>, except for the following. The path MUST be a
directory, and not an individual file. Changed or new files within
the directory are read automatically, without the need to send SIGHUP.
If a file is deleted or changed after it has been read by dnsmasq, then the
host record it contained will remain until dnsmasq receives a SIGHUP, or 
is restarted; ie host records are only added dynamically. The order in which the
files in a directory are read is not defined.</dd>
