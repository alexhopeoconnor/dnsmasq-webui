<dt><b>-8, --log-facility=&lt;facility&gt;</b></dt>
<dd>Set the facility to which dnsmasq will send syslog entries, this
defaults to DAEMON, and to LOCAL0 when debug mode is in operation. If
the facility given contains at least one '/' character, it is taken to
be a filename, and dnsmasq logs to the given file, instead of
syslog. If the facility is '-' then dnsmasq logs to stderr.
(Errors whilst reading configuration will still go to syslog,
but all output from a successful startup, and all output whilst
running, will go exclusively to the file.) When logging to a file,
dnsmasq will close and reopen the file when it receives SIGUSR2. This 
allows the log file to be rotated without stopping dnsmasq.</dd>
