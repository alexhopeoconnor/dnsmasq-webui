<dd>On systems which support it, dnsmasq binds the wildcard address,
even when it is listening on only some interfaces. It then discards
requests that it shouldn't reply to. This has the advantage of 
working even when interfaces come and go and change address. This
option forces dnsmasq to really bind only the interfaces it is
listening on. About the only time when this is useful is when 
running another nameserver (or another instance of dnsmasq) on the
same machine. Setting this option also enables multiple instances of
dnsmasq which provide DHCP service to run in the same machine.</dd>
