<dt><b>-y, --localise-queries</b></dt>
<dd>Return answers to DNS queries from /etc/hosts and <b>--interface-name</b> and <b>--dynamic-host</b> which depend on the interface over which the query was
received. If a name has more than one address associated with
it, and at least one of those addresses is on the same subnet as the
interface to which the query was sent, then return only the
address(es) on that subnet and return all the available addresses otherwise.
This allows for a server  to have multiple
addresses in /etc/hosts corresponding to each of its interfaces, and
hosts will get the correct address based on which network they are
attached to. Currently this facility is limited to IPv4.</dd>
