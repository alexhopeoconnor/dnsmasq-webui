<dt><b>--filter-rr=&lt;rrtype&gt;[,&lt;rrtype&gt;...]</b></dt>
<dd>Remove records of the specified type(s) from answers. The otherwise-nonsensical --filter-rr=ANY has
a special meaning: it filters replies to queries for type ANY. Everything other than A, AAAA, MX and CNAME
records are removed. Since ANY queries with forged source addresses can be used in DNS amplification attacks
(replies to ANY queries can be large) this defangs such attacks, whilst still supporting the
one remaining possible use of ANY queries. See RFC 8482 para 4.3 for details.</dd>
