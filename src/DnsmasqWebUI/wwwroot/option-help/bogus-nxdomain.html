<dt><b>-B, --bogus-nxdomain=&lt;ipaddr&gt;[/prefix]</b></dt>
<dd>Transform replies which contain the specified address or subnet into "No such
domain" replies. IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. This is intended to counteract a devious move made by
Verisign in September 2003 when they started returning the address of
an advertising web page in response to queries for unregistered names,
instead of the correct NXDOMAIN response. This option tells dnsmasq to
fake the correct response when it sees this behaviour. As at Sept 2003
the IP address being returned by Verisign is 64.94.110.11</dd>
