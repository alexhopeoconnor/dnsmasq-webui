<dt><b>-Q, --query-port=&lt;query_port&gt;</b></dt>
<dd>Send outbound DNS queries from, and listen for their replies on, the
specific UDP port &lt;query_port&gt; instead of using random ports. NOTE
that using this option will make dnsmasq less secure against DNS
spoofing attacks but it may be faster and use less resources.  Setting this option
to zero makes dnsmasq use a single port allocated to it by the
OS: this was the default behaviour in versions prior to 2.43.</dd>
