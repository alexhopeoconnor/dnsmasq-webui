<dt><b>-U, --dhcp-vendorclass=set:&lt;tag&gt;,[enterprise:&lt;IANA-enterprise number&gt;,]&lt;vendor-class&gt;</b></dt>
<dd>Map from a vendor-class string to a tag. Most DHCP clients provide a 
"vendor class" which represents, in some sense, the type of host. This option 
maps vendor classes to tags, so that DHCP options may be selectively delivered
to different classes of hosts. For example 
<b>--dhcp-vendorclass=set:printers,Hewlett-Packard JetDirect</b>

will allow options to be set only for HP printers like so:
<b>--dhcp-option=tag:printers,3,192.168.4.4 </b>

The vendor-class string is
substring matched against the vendor-class supplied by the client, to
allow fuzzy matching. The set: prefix is optional but allowed for
consistency. 
<p>
Note that in IPv6 only, vendorclasses are namespaced with an 
IANA-allocated enterprise number. This is given with enterprise:
keyword and specifies that only vendorclasses matching the specified
number should be searched.</dd>
