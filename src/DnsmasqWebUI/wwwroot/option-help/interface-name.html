<dt><b>--interface-name=&lt;name&gt;,&lt;interface&gt;[/4|/6]</b></dt>
<dd>Return DNS records associating the name with the address(es) of
the given interface. This flag specifies an A or AAAA record for the given
name in the same way as an /etc/hosts line, except that the address is
not constant, but taken from the given interface. The interface may be
followed by "/4" or "/6" to specify that only IPv4 or IPv6 addresses
of the interface should be used. If the interface is
down, not configured or non-existent, an empty record is returned. The
matching PTR record is also created, mapping the interface address to
the name. More than one name may be associated with an interface
address by repeating the flag; in that case the first instance is used
for the reverse address-to-name mapping. Note that a name used in 
<b>--interface-name</b> may not appear in /etc/hosts.</dd>
