<dt><b>-a, --listen-address=&lt;ipaddr&gt;</b></dt>
<dd>Listen on the given IP address(es). Both 
<b>--interface</b>

and
<b>--listen-address</b>

options may be given, in which case the set of both interfaces and
addresses is used. Note that if no
<b>--interface</b>

option is given, but 
<b>--listen-address</b>

is, dnsmasq will not automatically listen on the loopback
interface. To achieve this, its IP address, 127.0.0.1, must be
explicitly given as a 
<b>--listen-address</b>

option.</dd>
