<dt><b>-s, --domain=&lt;domain&gt;[[,&lt;address range&gt;[,local]]|&lt;interface&gt;]</b></dt>
<dd>Specifies DNS domains for the DHCP server. Domains may be be given 
unconditionally (without the IP range) or for limited IP ranges. This has two effects;
firstly it causes the DHCP server to return the domain to any hosts
which request it, and secondly it sets the domain which it is legal
for DHCP-configured hosts to claim. The intention is to constrain
hostnames so that an untrusted host on the LAN cannot advertise 
its name via DHCP as e.g. "microsoft.com" and capture traffic not 
meant for it. If no domain suffix is specified, then any DHCP
hostname with a domain part (ie with a period) will be disallowed 
and logged. If suffix is specified, then hostnames with a domain 
part are allowed, provided the domain part matches the suffix. In
addition, when a suffix is set then hostnames without a domain
part have the suffix added as an optional domain part. Eg on my network I can set 
<b>--domain=thekelleys.org.uk</b>

and have a machine whose DHCP hostname is "laptop". The IP address for that machine is available from 
<b>dnsmasq</b>

both as "laptop" and "laptop.thekelleys.org.uk". If the domain is
given as "#" then the domain is read from the first "search" directive
in /etc/resolv.conf (or equivalent).
<p>
The address range can be of the form
&lt;ip address&gt;,&lt;ip address&gt; or &lt;ip address&gt;/&lt;netmask&gt; or just a single
&lt;ip address&gt;. See 
<b>--dhcp-fqdn</b>

which can change the behaviour of dnsmasq with domains.
<p>
If the address range is given as ip-address/network-size, then a
additional flag "local" may be supplied which has the effect of adding
<b>--local</b> declarations for forward and reverse DNS queries. Eg.
<b>--domain=thekelleys.org.uk,192.168.0.0/24,local</b>

is identical to
<b>--domain=thekelleys.org.uk,192.168.0.0/24</b>
<b>--local=/thekelleys.org.uk/ --local=/0.168.192.in-addr.arpa/</b>
<p>
The address range can also be given as a network interface name, in which case
all of the subnets currently assigned to the interface are used in matching the
address. This allows hosts on different physical subnets to be given different
domains in a way which updates automatically as the interface addresses change.</dd>
