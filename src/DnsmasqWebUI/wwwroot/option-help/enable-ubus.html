<dd>Enable dnsmasq UBus interface. It sends notifications via UBus on
DHCPACK and DHCPRELEASE events. Furthermore it offers metrics
and allows configuration of Linux connection track mark based filtering.

UBus notifications are generated for each resolved or filtered DNS query.
Requires that dnsmasq has been built with UBus support. If the service
name is given, dnsmasq provides service at that namespace, rather than
the default which is
