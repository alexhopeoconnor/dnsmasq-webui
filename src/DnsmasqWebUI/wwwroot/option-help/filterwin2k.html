<dd>Later versions of windows make periodic DNS requests which don't get sensible answers from
the public DNS and can cause problems by triggering dial-on-demand links. This flag turns on an option
to filter such requests. The requests blocked are for records of type ANY
where the requested name has underscores, to catch LDAP requests, and for
<b>all</b> records of types SOA and SRV.</dd>
