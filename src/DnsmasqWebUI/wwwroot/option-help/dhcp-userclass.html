<dt><b>-j, --dhcp-userclass=set:&lt;tag&gt;,&lt;user-class&gt;</b></dt>
<dd>Map from a user-class string to a tag (with substring
matching, like vendor classes). Most DHCP clients provide a 
"user class" which is configurable. This option
maps user classes to tags, so that DHCP options may be selectively delivered
to different classes of hosts. It is possible, for instance to use
this to set a different printer server for hosts in the class
"accounts" than for hosts in the class "engineering".</dd>
