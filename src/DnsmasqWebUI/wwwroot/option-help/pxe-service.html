<dd>Most uses of PXE boot-ROMS simply allow the PXE
system to obtain an IP address and then download the file specified by
<b>--dhcp-boot</b>

and execute it. However the PXE system is capable of more complex
functions when supported by a suitable DHCP server.
<p>
This specifies a boot option which may appear in a PXE boot menu. &lt;CSA&gt; is
client system type, only services of the correct type will appear in a
menu. The known types are x86PC, PC98, IA64_EFI, Alpha, Arc_x86,
Intel_Lean_Client, IA32_EFI,  x86-64_EFI, Xscale_EFI, BC_EFI, ARM32_EFI and ARM64_EFI; an
integer may be used for other types. The
parameter after the menu text may be a file name, in which case dnsmasq acts as a
boot server and directs the PXE client to download the file by TFTP,
either from itself (
<b>--enable-tftp</b>

must be set for this to work) or another TFTP server if the final server
address/name is given.
Note that the "layer"
suffix (normally ".0") is supplied by PXE, and need not be added to
the basename. Alternatively, the basename may be a filename, complete with suffix, in which case
no layer suffix is added. If an integer boot service type, rather than a basename
is given, then the PXE client will search for a
suitable boot service for that type on the network. This search may be done
by broadcast, or direct to a server if its IP address/name is provided.  
If no boot service type or filename is provided (or a boot service type of 0 is specified)
then the menu entry will abort the net boot procedure and
continue booting from local media. The server address can be given as a domain
name which is looked up in /etc/hosts. This name can be associated in
/etc/hosts with multiple IP addresses, which are used round-robin.</dd>
