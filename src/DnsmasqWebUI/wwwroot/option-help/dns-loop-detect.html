<dt><b>--dns-loop-detect</b></dt>
<dd>Enable code to detect DNS forwarding loops; ie the situation where a query sent to one 
of the upstream server eventually returns as a new query to the dnsmasq instance. The
process works by generating TXT queries of the form &lt;hex&gt;.test and sending them to
each upstream server. The hex is a UID which encodes the instance of dnsmasq sending the query
and the upstream server to which it was sent. If the query returns to the server which sent it, then
the upstream server through which it was sent is disabled and this event is logged. Each time the
set of upstream servers changes, the test is re-run on all of them, including ones which
were previously disabled.</dd>
