<dt><b>-Z, --read-ethers</b></dt>
<dd>Read /etc/ethers for information about hosts for the DHCP server. The
format of /etc/ethers is a hardware address, followed by either a
hostname or dotted-quad IP address. When read by dnsmasq these lines
have exactly the same effect as
<b>--dhcp-host</b>

options containing the same information. /etc/ethers is re-read when 
dnsmasq receives SIGHUP. IPv6 addresses are NOT read from /etc/ethers.</dd>
