<dt><b>--dhcp-match=set:&lt;tag&gt;,&lt;option number&gt;|option:&lt;option name&gt;|vi-encap:&lt;enterprise&gt;[,&lt;value&gt;]</b></dt>
<dd>Without <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>, set <b>&lt;tag&gt;</b> if the client sends a DHCP
<b>option</b> of the given number or name. With <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>, set <b>&lt;tag&gt;</b> only if
the client sends the <b>option</b> matching or containing <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>. 
<p>
The value may be of the form
"01:ff:*:02" in which case the value must match (apart from wildcards)
but the option sent may have unmatched data past the end of the
value. The value may also be of the same form as in 
<b>--dhcp-option</b>

in which case the option sent is treated as an array, and one element
must match.
<b>--dhcp-match=set:efi-ia32,option:client-arch,6</b>

sets the tag <b>efi-ia32</b> if the number <b>6</b> appears in the list of
architectures sent by the client in option 93. (See RFC 4578 for
details.) If the value is a string, substring matching is used.
<p>
The special form with vi-encap:&lt;enterprise number&gt; matches against
vendor-identifying vendor classes for the specified enterprise. Please
see RFC 3925 for more details of these rare and interesting beasts.</dd>
