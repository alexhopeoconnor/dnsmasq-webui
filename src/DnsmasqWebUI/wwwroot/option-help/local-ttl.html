<dd>When replying with information from /etc/hosts or configuration or the DHCP leases
file dnsmasq by default sets the time-to-live field to zero, meaning
that the requester should not itself cache the information. This is
the correct thing to do in almost all situations. This option allows a
time-to-live (in seconds) to be given for these replies. This will
reduce the load on the server at the expense of clients using stale
data under some circumstances.</dd>
