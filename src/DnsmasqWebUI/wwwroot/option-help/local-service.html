<dt><b>--local-service[=net|host]</b></dt>
<dd>Without parameter or with net parameter, restricts service to connected network.
Accept DNS queries only from hosts whose address is on a local subnet,
ie a subnet for which an interface exists on the server. With host parameter, listens
only on lo interface and accepts queries from localhost only. This option
only has effect if there are no <b>--interface</b>, <b>--except-interface</b>,
<b>--listen-address</b> or <b>--auth-server</b> options. It is intended to be set as
a default on installation, to allow unconfigured installations to be
useful but also safe from being used for DNS amplification attacks.</dd>
