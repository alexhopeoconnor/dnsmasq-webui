<dt><b>--enable-ra</b></dt>
<dd>Enable dnsmasq's IPv6 Router Advertisement feature. DHCPv6 doesn't
handle complete network configuration in the same way as DHCPv4. Router
discovery and (possibly) prefix discovery for autonomous address
creation are handled by a different protocol. When DHCP is in use,
only a subset of this is needed, and dnsmasq can handle it, using
existing DHCP configuration to provide most data. When RA is enabled,
dnsmasq will advertise a prefix for each <b>--dhcp-range</b>, with default
router  as the relevant link-local address on 
the machine running dnsmasq. By default, the "managed address" bits are set, and
the "use SLAAC" bit is reset. This can be changed for individual
subnets with the mode keywords described in
<b>--dhcp-range.</b>

RFC6106 DNS parameters are included in the advertisements. By default,
the relevant link-local address of the machine running dnsmasq is sent
as recursive DNS server. If provided, the DHCPv6 options dns-server and
domain-search are used for the DNS server (RDNSS) and the domain search list (DNSSL).</dd>
