<dd>Copy the DNSSEC Authenticated Data bit from upstream servers to downstream clients.  This is an 
alternative to having dnsmasq validate DNSSEC, but it depends on the security of the network between 
dnsmasq and the upstream servers, and the trustworthiness of the upstream servers. Note that caching the
Authenticated Data bit correctly in all cases is not technically possible. If the AD bit is to be relied upon
when using this option, then the cache should be disabled using --cache-size=0. In most cases, enabling DNSSEC validation
within dnsmasq is a better option. See --dnssec for details.</dd>
