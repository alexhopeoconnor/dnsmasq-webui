<dd>Ignore replies to A or AAAA queries which include the specified address or subnet. 
No error is generated, dnsmasq simply continues to listen for another reply. 
This is useful to defeat blocking strategies which rely on quickly supplying a
forged answer to a DNS request for certain domain, before the correct answer can arrive.</dd>
