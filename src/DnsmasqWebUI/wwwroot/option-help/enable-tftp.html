<dt><b>--enable-tftp[=&lt;interface&gt;[,&lt;interface&gt;]]</b></dt>
<dd>Enable the TFTP server function. This is deliberately limited to that
needed to net-boot a client. Only reading is allowed; the tsize and
blksize extensions are supported (tsize is only supported in octet
mode). Without an argument, the TFTP service is provided to the same set of interfaces as DHCP service. 
If the list of interfaces is provided, that defines which interfaces receive TFTP service.</dd>
