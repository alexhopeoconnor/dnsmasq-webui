<dt><b>-9, --leasefile-ro</b></dt>
<dd>Completely suppress use of the lease database file. The file will not
be created, read, or written. Change the way the lease-change
script (if one is provided) is called, so that the lease database may
be maintained in external storage by the script. In addition to the
invocations  given in 
<b>--dhcp-script</b>

the lease-change script is called once, at dnsmasq startup, with the
single argument "init". When called like this the script should write
the saved state of the lease database, in dnsmasq leasefile format, to
stdout and exit with zero exit code. Setting this
option also forces the leasechange script to be called on changes
to the client-id and lease length and expiry time.</dd>
