<dd>(IPv4 only) Set BOOTP options to be returned by the DHCP server. Server name and
address are optional: if not provided, the name is left empty, and the
address set to the address of the machine running dnsmasq. If dnsmasq
is providing a TFTP service (see 
<b>--enable-tftp</b>

) then only the filename is required here to enable network booting.
If the optional tag(s) are given,
they must match for this configuration to be sent. 
Instead of an IP address, the TFTP server address can be given as a domain
name which is looked up in /etc/hosts. This name can be associated in
/etc/hosts with multiple IP addresses, which are used round-robin.
This facility can be used to load balance the tftp load among a set of servers.</dd>
