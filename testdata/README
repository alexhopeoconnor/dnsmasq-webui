# Test data

Source for the Docker test harness: `scripts/prepare-test-mount.sh` syncs this dir to `testdata-mount/`, which is bind-mounted as `/data`. Unit tests use the copy in the test output dir (copied at build via the .csproj).

## Layout

| File / dir | Purpose |
|------------|--------|
| **dnsmasq-test.conf** | Harness main config (`/data/dnsmasq-test.conf`). DNS + DHCP; `conf-dir=/data/dnsmasq.d`, multiple server/addn-hosts/address/dhcp-range. |
| **dnsmasq.conf** | Minimal main (conf-dir only). Used by unit tests when conf-dir is absent. |
| **dnsmasq.conf.example** | Commented example; not used by harness or tests. |
| **dnsmasq.d/** | Included configs (alphabetical order). |
| **dnsmasq.d/01-other.conf** | `domain=local`. Not managed. |
| **dnsmasq.d/02-servers.conf** | Extra `server=` / `local=` (readonly in UI). |
| **dnsmasq.d/03-more.conf** | `resolv-file=`, `dhcp-option=`. Not managed. |
| **dnsmasq.d/dhcp.conf** | `dhcp-host=`; managed by app in real use, used as-is in harness. |
| **hosts** | First addn-hosts file; system hosts when `Dnsmasq:SystemHostsPath` points here. |
| **hosts.extra** | Second addn-hosts file. |
| **resolv.dnsmasq** | Minimal file for resolv-file= in 03-more.conf; must exist so dnsmasq does not fail/warn. |
| **leases** | Sample DHCP leases for unit tests only; not synced to the harness. The harness uses the path from config (`dhcp-leasefile=` in dnsmasq-test.conf); the app discovers and monitors that file; dnsmasq creates it when DHCP clients obtain addresses. |

Harness usage (start/stop/tidy): see **agents.md** in the repo root.
